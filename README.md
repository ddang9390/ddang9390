## Hello, I am Daniel Dang ðŸ‘‹

I am an aspiring data analyst with a background in software development principles and quality assurance. I have a strong interest in using data to find optimal solutions to complex problems.

I started out as a QA tester with a background in software engineering. I have tested a variety of web applications which had led me to examining a number of ways the software could be developed and delivered to the user along with the ways that those users could utilize the products. This would lead to me becoming more interested in finding the reasons *why* some products worked and others didn't which would fuel my transition into the field of analytics.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:
- I am currently strengthening my programming foundations through using Python to create projects with a focus on analytics and studying algorithms. You can check out my **[MazePath Visualizer] https://github.com/ddang9390/MazePath-Visualizer** project to see how I went about comparing the performance of different search algorithms
- I am actively building my knowledge in the core data science libraries such as **Pandas, NumPY, Scikit-learn, and TensorFlow**
- I am developing my quantitative skills by studying **Calculus, Linear Algebra, and Statistics**


ðŸŽ¯ My Goals:
- I am preparing to apply for a **Masters in Analytics** program to gain an understanding of statistical modeling and machine learning
- My long-term goal is to work in the analytics field using my unique background and understanding in software quality to solve complex problems
